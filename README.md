[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/269767974.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/269767974)
Electro-chemo-mechanical model to investigate multi-pulse electric-field-driven integrin clustering  

* Working version contains the simulations used in publications.
* The Post-processing contains the summarized data output from the simulations, as well as plot functions.
* Optimized version contains the begininnging of a restructured model, which is currently incomplete.
